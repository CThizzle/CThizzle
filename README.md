- 👋 Hi, I’m @CThizzle or Chris!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code! So far ive practiced html,css and a bit of javascript. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of javascript so i can create my portfolio and hopefully get a job as a developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project or improve my own skill by completing my own projects.
